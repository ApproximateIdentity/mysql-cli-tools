This document explains how to set up a simple apt repository using reprepro.
There are many more details in the reprepro manpage.

First you need to pick a folder which will be the root of the repo (I'll assume
it is /apt/). Next you put the `description` and `options` files found in
reprepro/conf (in this repository) in the /apt/conf/ folder.

Next you're ready to add packages to the repository. Go into the /repo
directory and execute the following command:

    $ reprepro includedeb declass /path/to/$(package)_0.1-1_all.deb
    $ reprepro includedsc declass /path/to/$(package)_0.1-1_all.dsc

That's it. Add this repo to the /etc/apt/sources.list file to expose it to apt.
Use one of the following methods depending up on whether you're running it
remotely or locally (the second method means an ssh server needs to be running
while the third requires the repo to be served via http):

    deb file:/apt declass main
    deb-src file:/apt declass main

    deb copy:/apt declass main
    deb-src copy:/apt declass main

    deb http://0.0.0.0:8000/apt declass main
    deb-src http://0.0.0.0:8000/apt declass main

    deb ssh://repo-owner@repo.server.com:/apt declass main
    deb-src ssh://repo-owner@repo.server.com:/apt declass main

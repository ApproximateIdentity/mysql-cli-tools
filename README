mysql-cli-tools
---------------

This is a small collection of tools which are convenient for doing basic
mysql operations at the command line. None are especially fancy, but are
instead meant to allow you to avoid starting up a mysql-client to do basic
filesystem-like operations. Currently, the following two tools exist:

    * mv-mysql -- move (i.e. rename) a mysql database
    * ls-mysql -- list the databases of a mysql server

Eventually one more tool may be created, and the previously mentioned tools
may be expanded a bit in their functionality, but other than that this probably
will not evolve very much. The point is to be a little lazier in certain
specific use-cases.


Installation
------------

There is a Makefile allowing convenient installation/uninstallation to
/usr/local/bin/. If you would prefer to install it somewhere else, you can
simply copy the contents of the binary directory to that folder.

_Note_: If you happen to have programs installed in /usr/local/bin/ with the
same names as the ones provided here, the Makefile will happilly _overwrite_
them. Hence, use at your own risk.


OS Support
----------

I run Linux (derivatives of debian) and have not tried it anywhere else. It
should presumably work on any Linux distribution as well as 


Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 and the python module pymysql are required:

    * [ADD PYTHON 2.7 URL]
    * [ADD PYMYSQL URL]

Earlier versions of python may work, but they're not tested. If you need to
install pymysql, I recommend using pip.


Warning
-------

I am using these programs myself and do trust them, but they do deal with
database tables and therefore a bug causing data loss could be very
catastrophic. The implementations of pretty simple, but I cannot guarantee that
these programs are risk-free.

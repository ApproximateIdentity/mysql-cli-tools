mysql-cli-tools
---------------

This is a small collection of tools which are convenient for doing basic
mysql operations at the command line. None are especially fancy, but are
instead meant to allow you to avoid starting up a mysql-client to do basic
filesystem-like operations. Currently, the following two tools exist:

    * mv-mysql -- move (i.e. rename) a mysql database
    * ls-mysql -- list the databases of a mysql server

Eventually one more tool may be created, and the previously mentioned tools
may be expanded a bit in their functionality, but other than that this probably
will not evolve very much. The point is to be a little lazier in certain
specific use-cases.


Licence
-------

This software is licenced under version 3 of the GNU General Public Licence.
See the LICENCE file for details.


Installation
------------

There is a Makefile allowing convenient installation/uninstallation which uses
pip behind the hood. Run `make install` and `make uninstall` to
install/uninstall the package. If you would prefer to install it somewhere
else, you can simply copy the contents of the scripts/ directory to another
desired folder.


OS Support
----------

I run Linux (derivatives of debian) and have not tried it anywhere else. It
should presumably work on any Linux distribution and possibly as well on OSX.


Requirements
------------

Python 2.7 and the python module MySQLdb are required:

    * https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/
    * https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.4

Earlier versions of python may work, but they're not tested. If you need to
install MySQLdb, you can use pip (execute `pip MySQL-python`) or if you're
using a debian-derivative, you can use apt-get (`apt-get install
python-mysqldb`).


Warning
-------

I am using these programs myself and do trust them, but they do deal with
database tables and therefore a bug causing data loss could be very
catastrophic. The implementations of pretty simple, but I cannot guarantee that
these programs are risk-free.

Packaging
---------

To turn this into a debian package, you need to have the following debian
packages installed:

    * devscripts
    * python-all-dev
    * python-stdeb

First, generate a source distribution:

	$ python setup.py sdist

Next you need to generate the necessary debian package files:

	$ py2dsc -m 'Thomas Nyberg <tomnyberg@gmail.com>' dist/$package-$vers.tar.gz

_Note_: `package` is the name of the python package (at the time of writing,
it's `mysql-cli-tools`) and `vers` is the current version of the python package
(at the time of writing, it's `0.1`).

Next you need to go into the deb_dist/$(package)-$(vers)/debian/ folder and
make a couple changes.

_debian/control_:

    * Rename binary package name to mysql-cli-tools. We will not provide public
        module, so python- prefix is not needed.

    * Replace python-all with python in Build-Depends, we don't need all
        interpreters.

    * Add `X-Python-Version: >= 2.7` in source stanza. (It probably works with
        other versions, but they're not tested...)

    * Add `python-mysqldb (>= 1.2.3-2)` as a dependency.


_debian/rules_:

    * Change `python-mysql-cli-tools` to `mysql-cli-tools`

Finally build it with:

    $ debuild -uc -us


Automatic Building
------------------

Run `make package` to build the package automatically.

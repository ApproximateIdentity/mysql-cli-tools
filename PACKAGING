Packaging
---------

To turn this into a debian package, you need to have the following debian
packages installed:

    * devscripts
    * python-all-dev
    * python-stdeb

First, generate a source distribution:

	$ python setup.py sdist

Next you need to generate the necessary debian package files:

	$ py2dsc -m 'Thomas Nyberg <tomnyberg@gmail.com>' dist/$package-$vers.tar.gz

_Note_: `package` is the name of the python package (at the time of writing,
it's `mysql-cli-tools`) and `vers` is the current version of the python package
(at the time of writing, it's `0.1`).

Next you need to go into the deb_dist/$(package)-$(vers)/debian/ folder and
make a couple changes. The most important one is to make sure the dependencies
are listed. At the moment, the dependency you must add is `python-mysqldb`.
Also you might want to add a copyright file.

Finally build the package by running the following inside the
deb_dist/$(package)-$(vers) directory:

    $ debuild -uc -us
